Shufflesound is a Minecraft Spigot plugin that allows you to play a random sound.

Usage: `/shuffle <player> [volume] [pitch]`

All you need to do to use it is add one or more sounds.json files to the `json` directory and it'll play any one random sound specified from those lists to whatever target you specify, as long as the target player also has the sound defined on their client.
